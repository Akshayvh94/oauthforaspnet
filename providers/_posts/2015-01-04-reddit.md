## 1. Register an application in Reddit

In Reddit, go to the [Apps page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and click on the "are you a developer? create an app..." button. For the "Redirect URI" field you will need the specify the URL for your application with the `/signin-reddit` suffix, e.g. `http://localhost:4515/signin-reddit`. Complete the application registration information and when you are finished take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields as indicated in the image below, as you will need these when registering the Reddit OAuth provider in your ASP.NET application.

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the Reddit OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider
 
Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.Reddit` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.Reddit;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following line of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseRedditAuthentication("Your client id", "Your client secret");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Request extra (or less) permissions

By default the Reddit provider will request the `identity`, `mysubreddits` and `privatemessages` OAuth scopes. If you want to request more permissions, you will need to add these to the `Scope` property:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new RedditAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret"
};
options.Scope.Add("edit");
app.UseRedditAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

The Reddit provider is by default a bit eager in terms of the permissions it requests. If you want to you can always request less permissions by clearing the `Scope` property. Just make sure that you always at least request the `identity` otherwise the authentication will not be successful:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new RedditAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret"
};
options.Scope.Clear();
options.Scope.Add("identity");
app.UseRedditAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

For more information on the available scopes, go to the [Reddit OAuth documentation](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api/oauth) and sort the API Methods by Auth Scope in order the see what scope is required for a specific method.

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the Reddit provider will request Reddit to redirect to the path `/signin-reddit` after the user has signed in and granted permissions on Reddit. You can specify an alternative redirect URL:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new RedditAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    CallbackPath = new PathString("/oauth-redirect/reddit")
};
app.UseRedditAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

You will also need to ensure that the Redirect URI you specified when registering your application in Reddit matches this value.

### Retrieve access token and other user information returned from Reddit

You can retrieve the user information returned from Reddit in the `OnAuthenticated` callback function which gets invoked after the user has authenticated with Reddit:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new RedditAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    Provider = new RedditAuthenticationProvider
    {
        OnAuthenticated = async context =>
        {
            // Retrieve the OAuth access token to store for subsequent API calls
            string accessToken = context.AccessToken;

            // Retrieve the user's Reddit ID
            string userId = context.Id;

            // Retrieve the user's Reddit username
            string userName = context.UserName;

            // You can even retrieve the full JSON-serialized user
            var serializedUser = context.User;
        }
    }
};
app.UseRedditAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}
