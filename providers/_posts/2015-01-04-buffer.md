## 1. Register an application in Buffer

Go to your [Buffer Registered Apps](https://bufferapp.com/developers/apps) page, click the "Create an App" button and complete the information for a new application. For the Redirect URI your need to specify the URL to your application, with a `/signin-buffer` suffix, e.g. `http://localhost:4515/signin-buffer`.

After you have registered the application, Buffer will send you an email containing the Client ID and Client Secret which you need to use when enabling Buffer authentication in your ASP.NET application.

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the Buffer OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider

Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.Buffer` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.Buffer;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following lines of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseBufferAuthentication("Your client id", "Your client secret");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Request extra permissions

The Buffer OAuth implementation does not support scopes, so there is no way - and also not need - to request specific permissions via scopes. When a user gives your application access to their Buffer account, your application will have full access to manage their Buffer account.

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the Buffer provider will request Buffer to redirect to the path `/signin-buffer after the user has signed in and granted permissions on the Buffer website. You can specify an alternative callback path:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new BufferAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    CallbackPath = new PathString("/oauth-redirect/buffer")
};
app.UseBufferAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

> You need to also make sure that the **Redirect URI** of your application in Buffer matches this new callback path.

### Retrieve access token and other user information returned from Buffer

You can retrieve the access token and other user information returned from Buffer in the `OnAuthenticated` callback function which gets invoked after the user has authenticated with Buffer:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new BufferAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    Provider = new BufferAuthenticationProvider
    {
        OnAuthenticated = async context =>
        {
            // Retrieve the OAuth access token to store for subsequent API calls
            string accessToken = context.AccessToken;

            // Retrieve the user's account ID on buffer
            string userId = context.Id;

            // You can even retrieve the full JSON-serialized user
            var serializedUser = context.User;
        }
    }
};
app.UseBufferAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}
