## Introduction
A lot of applications these days allow users to sign in using their existing login credentials from a social networking service such as Facebook.  This simplifies the login process as users do not have to remember multiple login credentials for various websites, and it also provides the application developer in turn access to certain demographical information from the user.

ASP.NET MVC 5 has support for social logins built in, but as an app developer you will still need to go trough a few steps to enable this on your application.  This guide will help you through the process of allowing users to log in with their Facebook account in a step-by-step manner.

To follow this guide you will need to have a Facebook account.  If you do not have an account then head on over to the [Facebook Homepage](http://www.facebook.com) and register before you continue any further.

## Registering as a Facebook App Developer
Before you can add Facebook login to your web application you will need to register an application in Facebook, and before you can do that you will need to be registered as a Facebook Developer.  To register as a Facebook developer simply head on over to the [Facebook Developers Page](https://developers.facebook.com/).  Click on the "Register Now" button in the top right corner to add Facebook developer capabilities to your Facebook account.

You will be guided through the rest of the process by proceeding through a set of steps.  The first step is to accept the Facebook Platform Policy and the Facebook Privacy Policy.

The next step is to verify your account by associating your mobile phone number with your account.  This is to verify firstly that you are a real person and also to prevent you from registering multiple Facebook developer accounts (or even multiple Facebook accounts for that matter).

After verifying your account you will be prompted to share some additional information about yourself with Facebook.

The last step is just confirmation that you have successfully registered.

##Registering your application

To register a new Facebook application head over to the [Facebook Developer page](https://developer.facebook.com) and select "Create a New App" from the Apps menu at the top of the page.

![](/images/guides/facebook/create_new_app_menu.png)

Complete the information on the "Create the New App" dialog by supplying the name of your application as well as selecting the relevant Category for your web application. 

![](/images/guides/facebook/create_new_app.png)

Click on the "Create App" button and fill in the information for the security check when prompted for it.

You will be taken to a page displaying the dashboard for your application. Click on the "Settings" menu in the left hand navigation bar.

Take note of the values for the "App ID" and "App Secret" fields as your will need these when enabling Facebook login in your ASP.NET MVC application.  To view the App Secret click on the "Show" button next the the app secret.

> Please note that Facebook apps now have to go through an approval process before they can be made live. For the most up to date instructions please refer to the Facebook documentation at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review. Furthermore you should also take note that once you are ready to go live with your app your will have to take it out Development Mode and make it Live. More info on the app lifecycle can be found at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/bestpractice/managing-development-cycle.

##Enabling Facebook authentication in your ASP.NET MVC Application
The next step is to add the Facebook login to your ASP.NET MVC application.  For this we will create a new ASP.NET MVC application using Visual Studio. Go to File > New > Project and select the template for a new "ASP.NET Web Application" and click "OK".

![](/images/guides/facebook/new_project.png)

Next, select the MVC project template and ensure that the **authentication** method is set to "Individual User Accounts".  Click "OK".

![](/images/guides/facebook/new_project_mvc.png)

> After the project wizard has completed I would advise you to update your NuGet packages before you proceed.  To do this you can right click on the solution file and select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...".  In the "Manage Nuget Packages" dialog you can navigate to the Updates node and ensure that you install any updates.

Once the application has been created you can navigate to the `Startup.Auth` file located in the `App_Start` folder of your application and open the file.

![](/images/guides/facebook/navigate_startup_auth.png)

Locate the lines of code which enables the Facebook authentication (look for `app.UseFacebookAuthentication`) and uncomment it.  Take the values for the "App Id" and "App Secret" from your Facebook application and pass it through as the parameters for the `app.UseFacebookAuthentication` method call:

	app.UseFacebookAuthentication(
    	appId: "315934731886834",
    	appSecret: "09cc8d6dcdc0e916d070f82fcce8bf43");


It is important to ensure that these parameter match the values from Facebook exactly, otherwise the Facebook authentication for your application will fail.

##Enabling the application domain in Facebook
When Facebook is used as authentication for your application it validates that the request for authentication has originated from a valid domain which you specify.  This means that you will need to register your application's website domain against your Facebook application.  

First we need to get the domain for out website. Right click on your web project in Visual Studio and select 'Properties".  In the properties windows navigate to the "Web" tab and copy your application URL in the "Project Url" field:

Return to the Facebook Developer website and go to the application settings page for your Facebook Application. Click on the "Add Platform" button.

![](/images/guides/facebook/add_platform_button.png)

Select "Website"

![](/images/guides/facebook/select_platform.png)

Enter the URL for your website which you copied form your Visual Studio project properties into the "Site URL" field.  

![](/images/guides/facebook/facebook_website_details.png)

Click on the "Save Changes" button.

##Testing the application
You have now created an application in Facebook and enabled the Facebook authentication in your application.  The last step is to ensure that everything works.  Run your application by selecting the Debug > Start Debugging menu item or pressing the F5 key in Visual Studio.

The application will open in your web browser.  Select the "Log In" menu at the top.

![](/images/guides/facebook/application_start_screen.png)

Under the "Use another service to log in" section you will see a button which allows you to log in with Facebook.  Click the "Facebook" button.

![](/images/guides/facebook/application_login_screen.png)

You will be redirected to the Facebook website.  If you are not logged in to Facebook yet you will be prompted to do so.  Facebook will then prompt you to give the application permissions to access your public profile and friends list.

![](/images/guides/facebook/facebook_permission.png)

Click on the "Okay" button.  You will be redirected back to your application and will need to supply your email address to complete the registration process.

![](/images/guides/facebook/complete_registration.png)

Once you have filled in your email address and clicked the "Register" button you will be logged into the application.  You can now log in to the application using your Facebook account in the future.

##A final note about the Facebook application registration process
As noted in the section above you need to register you website's domain in the Facebook application.  You can however only register a single website domain for an application which work fine while you develop, but once you go into production it proves to be a problem as you cannot register both your `localhost` domain as well as your `.com` domain.

It is therefore suggested that you create two applications.  One for development and one for production, each with its own domain. This setup is also better for security purposes as you can limit the people who have knowledge of the Application ID and Secret of the production application to a much smaller group.
