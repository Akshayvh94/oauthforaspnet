## 1. Register an application in Twitch

To register a new application go to the [Connection area](http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) of your Twitch Settings. At the bottom you will see all applications you have previously registered, as well as a link to register a new application. Click on the link to [register a new application](http://www.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/clients/new) and complete all the required information.

For the Redirect URI your need to specify the URL of your application, with the suffix `/signin-Twitch`, e.g. `http://localhost:4515/signin-Twitch`. 

> Please note that the case of the suffix is important, so the "Twitch" part of "signin-Twitch" must start with a capital T. If you get this wrong the authentication will fail.

Once you have completed the process to register a new application, take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** as you will need these when configuring the Twitch OAuth provider in your ASP.NET application:

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the Twitch OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider
 
Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.Twitch` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.Twitch;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following lines of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseTwitchAuthentication("Your client id", "Your client secret");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Request extra permissions

By default the Twitch provider will request the `user_read` scope. To request extra permissions, you will need to add those to the scope property:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new TwitchAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id", 
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret"
};
options.Scope.Add("user_subscriptions");
app.UseTwitchAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

For a full list of the available scopes, have a look at the relevant section in the [Twitch API Documentation](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/authentication.md#scopes)

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the Twitch provider will request Twitch to redirect to the path `/signin-Twitch` after the user has signed in and granted permissions on Twitch. You can specify an alternative redirect URL:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new TwitchAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id", 
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    CallbackPath = new PathString("/oauth-redirect/twitch")
};
app.UseTwitchAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

You will also need to ensure that the Redirect URI you specified when registering your application in Twitch matches this value.

### Retrieve access token and other user information returned from Twitch

You can retrieve the user information returned from Twitch in the `OnAuthenticated` callback function which gets invoked after the user has authenticated with Twitch:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new TwitchAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id", 
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    Provider = new TwitchAuthenticationProvider
    {
        OnAuthenticated = async context =>
        {
            // Retrieve the OAuth access token to store for subsequent API calls
            string accessToken = context.AccessToken;

            // Retrieve the user's name
            string userDisplayName = context.Name;

            // Retrieve the user's email address
            var userEmail = context.Email;

            // You can even retrieve the full JSON-serialized user
            var serializedUser = context.User;
        }
    }
};
app.UseTwitchAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}
