## 1. Register an app in GitHub

In GitHub go to your Settings page and in the left hand navigation select Applications. Under Developer applications, click the button labeled "Register new Application" and go through the steps to register the application. After you have registered the application, take note of the Client ID and Client Secret.

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the GitHub OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider

Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.GitHub` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.GitHub;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following lines of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseGitHubAuthentication(
    clientId: "Your Client ID",
    clientSecret: "Your Client Secret");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Request extra permissions

By default no scope is specified, which grants read-only access to public information (includes public user profile info, public repository info, and gists). If you want to request more permissions, you will need to add these to he `Scope` property:

{% highlight csharp %}
{% endhighlight %}

> For the full list of available scopes, see the [GitHub OAuth documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes).

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the GitHub provider will request GitHub to redirect to the path `/signin-github` after the user has signed in and granted permissions on GitHub. You can specify an alternative redirect URL:

{% highlight csharp %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Retrieve user information returned from GitHub
