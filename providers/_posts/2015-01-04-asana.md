## 1. Register an application in Asana

Go to your Asana [Account Settings dialog](https://app.asana.com/-/account_api) and select the Apps tab. Click the link which says "Developers: Register New Application" and complete the information for a new application. For the Redirect URI your need to specify the URL to your application, with a `/signin-asana` suffix, e.g. `http://localhost:4515/signin-asana`.

After you have registered the application take note of the Client ID and Client Secret, as you will need these when registering the provider in your ASP.NET Application:

## 2. Install the Nuget Package

Install the Nuget Package which contains the Asana OAuth provider.

{% highlight bash %}
Install-Package Install-Package Owin.Security.Providers
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Register Provider

Locate the file in your project called `\App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. Ensure that you have imported the `Owin.Security.Providers.Asana` namespace:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Owin.Security.Providers.Asana;
{% endhighlight %}

In the `ConfigureAuth` method add the following lines of code:

{% highlight csharp %}
app.UseAsanaAuthentication("Your client id", "Your client secret");
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. Advanced Configuration

### Request extra permissions

The Asana OAuth implementation does not support scopes, so there is no way - and also not need - to request specific permissions via scopes. As per the Asana authentication dialog, when a user authorize's your app, they will give it permission to:
* Access their name and email address.
* Access their tasks, projects, and workspaces.
* Create and modify tasks, projects, and comments on their behalf.

### Specify an alternative callback path

By default the Asana provider will request Asana to redirect to the path `/signin-asana after the user has signed in and granted permissions on the Asana website. You can specify an alternative callback path:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new AsanaAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    CallbackPath = new PathString("/oauth-redirect/asana")
};
app.UseAsanaAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}

> You need to also make sure that the **Redirect URL** of your application in Asana matches this new callback path.

### Retrieve access token and other user information returned from Asana

You can retrieve the access token and other user information returned from Asana in the `OnAuthenticated` callback function which gets invoked after the user has authenticated with Asana:

{% highlight csharp %}
var options = new AsanaAuthenticationOptions
{
    ClientId = "Your client id",
    ClientSecret = "Your client secret",
    Provider = new AsanaAuthenticationProvider
    {
        OnAuthenticated = async context =>
        {
            // Retrieve the OAuth access token to store for subsequent API calls
            string accessToken = context.AccessToken;

            // Retrieve the user's full name
            string userFullName = context.Name;

            // Retrieve the user's email address
            string userEmail = context.Email;

            // You can even retrieve the full JSON-serialized user
            var serializedUser = context.User;
        }
    }
};
app.UseAsanaAuthentication(options);
{% endhighlight %}
