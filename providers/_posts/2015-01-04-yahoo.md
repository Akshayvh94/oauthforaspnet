## Introduction
A lot of applications these days allow users to sign in using their existing login credentials from a social networking service such as Facebook, Twitter or Yahoo.  This simplifies the login process as users do not have to remember multiple login credentials for various websites, and it also provides the application developer in turn access to certain demographical information from the user.

ASP.NET MVC 5 has support for social logins built in, but as an app developer you will still need to go trough a few steps to register your application with Yahoo and enable this in your website.  

ASP.NET MVC 5 does not support signing in with Yahoo as part of the standard external authentication services, but support for Yahoo authentication is available through an open source NuGet package. This guide will help you through the process of enabling Yahoo signin in your application in a step-by-step manner.

To follow this guide you will need to have a Yahoo account.  If you do not have an account then head on over to the [Yahoo Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com/) and register before you continue any further.

## Registering an application on Yahoo
In order for you to use Yahoo as an external authentication provider in your website, you will need to register a project on the Yahoo Developer Network.  Go to the [Yahoo Developer Network website](https://developer.yahoo.com/) and the "My Projects" menu from the account menu at the top right of the page.

You will see a list of any existing projects you may have created before.  Click on the "Create a Project" button.

![](/images/guides/yahoo/yahoo_projects_list.png)

Enter the name and description of your application and specify the application type as "Web-based". 

![](/images/guides/yahoo/yahoo_project_1.png)

Under "Access Scopes" make sure that you have selected "This app requires access to private user data". Specify you website domain in the Callback Domain field. You also need to ensure that **at least one** of the APIs are selected under "Select APIs for private user data access".  In this case we selected "Contacts".

> **Please note:** The Callback domain for Yahoo cannot point to localhost or a URL containing a port number, which will typically be the case when you are in development mode using IIS Express. To work around this problem you will need a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and specify the `Callback Domain` as http://ngrok.com. 
> 
> Here is a very good blog post on the Twilio website which explains how to configure ngrok to work with IIS or IIS Express: [Configure Windows for Local Webhook Testing Using ngrok](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/03/configure-windows-for-local-webhook-testing-using-ngrok.html)

Finally make sure that you accept the terms of use and click the "Create Project" button.

After the application has been created you need to take note of the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret as these will be needed when you enable authentication via Yahoo in your ASP.NET MVC application.

##Enabling Yahoo authentication in your ASP.NET MVC Application
The next step is to add the Yahoo login to your ASP.NET MVC application.  For this we will create a new ASP.NET MVC application using Visual Studio. Go to File > New > Project and select the template for a new "ASP.NET Web Application" and click "OK".

![](/images/guides/yahoo/new_project.png)

Next, select the MVC project template and ensure that the **authentication** method is set to "Individual User Accounts".  Click "OK".

![](/images/guides/yahoo/new_project_mvc.png)

> After the project wizard has completed I would advise you to update your NuGet packages before you proceed.  To do this you can right click on the solution file and select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...".  In the "Manage Nuget Packages" dialog you can navigate to the Updates node and ensure that you install any updates.

Next we need to install the **Owin.Security.Providers** Nuget package which will give us access to the Yahoo authentication provider.  Right click on your web project and select "Manage Nuget Packages...". Select the "Online" node in the "Manage Nuget Packages" dialog and search for the package named "Owin.Security.Providers".  Click "Install" to install the package into your project.

> The **Owin.Security.Providers** Nuget package was developed by myself with contributions from others.  If you want to add extra functionality to any of the providers or add new providers for other services I would appreciate the contributions.  Please fork the repository located at [https://github.com/owin-middleware/OwinOAuthProviders](https://github.com/owin-middleware/OwinOAuthProviders) and send a pull request.

Navigate to the `Startup.Auth` file located in the `App_Start` folder of your application and open the file.

![](/images/guides/yahoo/navigate_startup_auth.png)

Add a line at the top of the file to include the namespace for the Yahoo provider.

	using Owin.Security.Providers.Yahoo;

Enable the Yahoo provider by making a call to the `app.UseGitYahooAuthentication` method passing in the Consumer Key of your Yahoo application as the `consumerKey` parameter and the Consumer Secret as the `consumerSecret` parameter.

	app.UseYahooAuthentication(
	    consumerKey: "dj0yJmk9c1BpNXc0eHRvMUF3JmQ9WVdrOVMzQm5RV0poTjJrbWNHbzlNQS0tJnM9Y29uc3VtZXJzZWNyZXQmeD1kYQ--",
	    consumerSecret: "0cebda50c13f2f4d13d3eac36e5d9593bfaf6f71");

It is important to ensure that these parameters match the values from Yahoo exactly, otherwise the Yahoo authentication for your application will fail.

##Testing the application
You have now created a project in Yahoo and enabled the Yahoo authentication in your application.  The last step is to ensure that everything works.  Run your application by selecting the Debug > Start Debugging menu item or pressing the F5 key in Visual Studio.

The application will open in your web browser.  Select the "Log In" menu at the top.

![](/images/guides/yahoo/application_start_screen.png)

Under the "Use another service to log in" section you will see a button which allows you to log in with Yahoo.  Click the "Yahoo" button.

![](/images/guides/yahoo/application_login_screen.png)

You will be redirected to the Yahoo website.  If you are not logged in to Yahoo yet you will be prompted to do so.  Yahoo will then prompt you to give the application permissions to access your Yahoo Contacts.

![](/images/guides/yahoo/yahoo_permission.png)

Click on the "Agree" button.  You will be redirected back to your application and will need to supply your email address to complete the registration process.

Once you have filled in your email address and clicked the "Register" button you will be logged into the application.  You can now log in to the application using your Yahoo account in the future.
