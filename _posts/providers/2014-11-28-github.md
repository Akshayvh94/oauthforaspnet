##Introduction
A lot of applications these days allow users to sign in using their existing login credentials from a social networking service such as Facebook or Twitter.  This simplifies the login process as users do not have to remember multiple login credentials for various websites, and it also provides the application developer in turn access to certain demographical information from the user.

ASP.NET MVC 5 has support for social logins built in, but as an app developer you will still need to go trough a few steps to enable this on your application.  If you develop an application which is geared towards developers you may want to allow your users to sign in to your application using GitHub.  

ASP.NET MVC 5 does not support signing in with GitHub as part of the standard external authentication services, but support for GitHub authentication is available through an open source NuGet package. This guide will help you through the process of enabling GitHub signin in your application in a step-by-step manner.

To follow this guide you will need to have a GitHub account.  If you do not have an account then head on over to the [GitHub Homepage](http://www.github.com) and register before you continue any further.

##Registering an application in GitHub
In order for you to use GitHub as an external authentication provider in your website, you will need to create an application in GitHub.  Sign in to your GitHub account and navigate to your Account settings by clicking on the Account Settings icon on the top right of the GitHub website.

Navigate to the Applications section by selection "Applications" in the Account Settings sidebar menu.

In the "Developer applications" section click on the "Register new application" button.

![](/images/guides/github/developer_applications_section.png)

Complete the name and homepage URL fields for your application and click the "Register application" button.

> The "Authorization callback URL" field will also need to be completed before the GitHub authentication can work correctly.  We cover this in the section below entitled "Specifying the authorization callback URL for your application"

After the application registration is complete your will be redirected to the application page.  Take note of the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" as these will be needed when enabling the GitHub authentication in your ASP.NET MVC application.

##Enabling GitHub authentication in your ASP.NET MVC Application
The next step is to add the GitHub login to your ASP.NET MVC application.  For this we will create a new ASP.NET MVC application using Visual Studio. Go to File > New > Project and select the template for a new "ASP.NET Web Application" and click "OK".

![](/images/guides/github/new_project.png)

Next, select the MVC project template and ensure that the **authentication** method is set to "Individual User Accounts".  Click "OK".

![](/images/guides/github/new_project_mvc.png)

> After the project wizard has completed I would advise you to update your NuGet packages before you proceed.  To do this you can right click on the solution file and select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...".  In the "Manage Nuget Packages" dialog you can navigate to the Updates node and ensure that you install any updates.

Next we need to install the **Owin.Security.Providers** Nuget package which will give us access to the GitHub authentication provider.  Right click on your web project and select "Manage Nuget Packages...". Select the "Online" node in the "Manage Nuget Packages" dialog and search for the package named "Owin.Security.Providers".  Click "Install" to install the package into your project.

> The **Owin.Security.Providers** Nuget package was developed by myself with contributions from others.  If you want to add extra functionality to any of the providers or add new providers for other services I would appreciate the contributions.  Please fork the repository located at [https://github.com/owin-middleware/OwinOAuthProviders](https://github.com/owin-middleware/OwinOAuthProviders) and send a pull request.

Navigate to the `Startup.Auth` file located in the `App_Start` folder of your application and open the file.

![](/images/guides/github/navigate_startup_auth.png)

Add a line at the top of the file to include the namespace for the Nuget provider.

	using Owin.Security.Providers.GitHub;


Enable the GitHub provider by making a call to the `app.UseGitHubAuthentication` method passing in the Client ID of your GitHub application as the `clientId` parameter and the Client Secret as the `clientSecret` parameter.


	app.UseGitHubAuthentication(
    	clientId: "f12bd74d4e0fd5a49976",
    	clientSecret: "8d5b4483d450c276349687e80f618d4069b3df65");


It is important to ensure that these parameters match the values from GitHub exactly, otherwise the GitHub authentication for your application will fail.

##Specifying the authorization callback URL for your application
In order for the GitHub authentication to work your need to specify the correct authorization callback URL in GitHub for your application.

First we need to get the domain for out website. Right click on your web project in Visual Studio and select 'Properties".  In the properties windows navigate to the "Web" tab and copy your application URL in the "Project Url" field:

![](/images/guides/github/project_properties.png)

Open your application settings in GitHub and update the "Authorization Callback URL" field with the URL of your application, appending the path "/signin-github" to the URL as indicated in the screenshot below:

![](/images/guides/github/update_github_application_callback.png)

Click on the "Update application" button.

> You can only specify one callback URL per application.  It is therefore suggested that you register separate applications for your development, production and other environments, each with its own callback URL.  More on this below in the section "A final note about the GitHub application registration process".

##Testing the application
You have now created an application in GitHub and enabled the GitHub authentication in your application.  The last step is to ensure that everything works.  Run your application by selecting the Debug > Start Debugging menu item or pressing the F5 key in Visual Studio.

The application will open in your web browser.  Select the "Log In" menu at the top.

![](/images/guides/github/application_start_screen.png)

Under the "Use another service to log in" section you will see a button which allows you to log in with GitHub.  Click the "GitHub" button.

![](/images/guides/github/application_login_screen.png)

You will be redirected to the GitHub website.  If you are not logged in to GitHub yet you will be prompted to do so.  GitHub will then prompt you to give the application permissions to access your personal user data.

![](/images/guides/github/github_permission.png)

Click on the "Authorize application" button.  You will be redirected back to your application and will need to supply your email address to complete the registration process.

![](/images/guides/github/complete_registration.png)

Once you have filled in your email address and clicked the "Register" button you will be logged into the application.  You can now log in to the application using your GitHub account in the future.

##A final note about the GitHub application registration process
As noted in the section above you need to register the authorization callback URL in the GitHub application.  This callback URL will obviously differ when your application is running on your development maching (i.e running on localhost) or when your application is running in production.  You can also only specify a single callback URL per application.

It is therefore suggested that you create two applications.  One for development and one for production, each with its own callback URL. This setup is also better for security purposes as you can limit the people who have knowledge of the Client ID and Secret of the production application to a much smaller group.
