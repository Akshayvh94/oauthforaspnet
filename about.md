At the end of 2013 I started working on and [published a Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/owin.security.providers) which gives ASP.NET developers the capability to allow their users to authenticate with a whole lot of OAuth authentication services, besides the ones which comes out of the box with ASP.NET. I started writing some blog posts with guides on how to configure these various providers, and over time the amount of guides became substantial enough that I decided to put it into a separate website, and thus OAuth for ASP.NET was born.

This project is open source and I welcome contributions. It is developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I do not have any formal documentation or style guides, so if you want to contribute then please look at the existing guides and stick to doing it in a similar fashion (i.e. tone, style, etc.).

So please feel free to [fork the repository](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/oauthforaspnet) and submit a pull request. Even if you just see a small spelling mistake, or notice that some information is outdated and you want to fix it, please do so.

If all of that is too much for you then you can also [create an issue on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/oauthforaspnet/issues).
